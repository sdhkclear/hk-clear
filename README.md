## Description
An interview question solution.
## Process
- First looked up the proposal document for Space Packet Protocol.
- Took notes on the prompt to ensure I understood the input and output requirements.
- Started making assumptions list.
- Set up project & repo. I normally use VS Code-generated build configs, but used make for ease of use by recipients.

## Assumptions made
- C bit-fields are acceptable. These were not used at my last employer, but are being used in the interest of time and readability.
