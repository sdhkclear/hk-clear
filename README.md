# hk-clear
## Description
An interview question solution.
## Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sdhkclear/hk-clear/
$ cd hk-clear
$ make
$ ./build/hk-clear
```

## Process
- First looked up the proposal document for Space Packet Protocol.
- Took notes on the prompt to ensure I understood the input and output requirements.
- Started making assumptions list.
- Set up project & repo. I used make for ease of use by recipients.

## Assumptions made
- C bit-fields are acceptable. These were not used at my last employer, but are being used in the interest of time and readability.
- The updated on-board bit field does not literally have to be the output of the function and it can instead be updated in-place.
- The standard given in the question document is 100% correct. If this were a real work assignment I would have questions before starting.
- Verification of the command input has been done elsewhere.
